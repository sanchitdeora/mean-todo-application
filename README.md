# TODO Applicaiton using MEAN Stack

## Project Description
This full stack web application uses REST services to perform the following actions:
* Sign up and Login User.
* Create, Edit and Delete To-do Lists in the Dashboard.
* Create, Edit and Delete Tasks in the To-do Lists.
* Invite Users to share and edit the To-do List.

This application uses a MEAN Stack application, i.e. MongoDB, Express.js, Angular 9 and Node.js.  

## Development server

Run `nodemon` for a back-end server in the main folder. This will run the server on the `http://localhost:9999`. `Nodemon` allows the backend server to reload the source files automatically if there are any changes.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server in the /client folder. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. Run `ng serve --open` to automtically open in the default browser.
